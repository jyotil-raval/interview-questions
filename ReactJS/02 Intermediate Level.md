# [Intermediate Level](/ReactJS/README.MD#intermediate-level)

## 1> Describe the differences between useState() and useReducer() hooks

> _Purpose_: Both useState() and useReducer() are React hooks used for managing state in functional components, but they have different purposes and usage patterns.

> _Process_: useState() is simpler and more straightforward, primarily used for managing individual state variables. It returns a state variable and a function to update that variable. On the other hand, useReducer() is more powerful and allows managing more complex state logic by using a reducer function similar to how state is managed in Redux.

> _Example_:

```jsx
// useState example
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

// useReducer example
const initialState = { count: 0 };
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
};
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
```

> _Result_: useState() is suitable for simple state management needs, while useReducer() is more appropriate for complex state logic or when multiple state transitions depend on the previous state.

> _Conclusion_: Understanding the differences between useState() and useReducer() helps developers choose the appropriate state management approach based on the complexity and requirements of their React components.

## 2> How do you optimize performance in React applications?

> _Purpose_: Performance optimization in React aims to improve the rendering speed and overall responsiveness of applications, leading to a better user experience.

> _Process_: Performance optimization techniques include minimizing re-renders, reducing unnecessary component updates, lazy loading components and data, using memoization, and optimizing network requests.

> _Example_:

```jsx
// Memoization example using useMemo
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);

// Lazy loading example using React.lazy and Suspense
const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./OtherComponent'));

// Optimizing network requests example using useEffect
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    const result = await axios.get('https://api.example.com/data');
    setData(result.data);
  };
  fetchData();
}, []);
```

> _Result_: By implementing performance optimization techniques, React applications can achieve faster rendering times, reduced resource consumption, and improved responsiveness, leading to a better user experience and higher user satisfaction.

> _Conclusion_: Prioritizing performance optimization in React applications is essential for delivering high-quality and efficient software solutions that meet users' expectations and requirements.

## 3> Explain the concept of React Router and how it is used for routing in React applications

> _Purpose_: React Router is a popular library used for handling routing in React applications, allowing developers to navigate between different components/pages based on the URL.

> _Process_: React Router provides a <Router> component that wraps the application and enables routing functionality. Developers can define routes using <Route> components, specifying the URL path and the component to render when the path matches.

> _Example_:

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route path='/' exact component={Home} />
        <Route path='/about' component={About} />
        <Route path='/contact' component={Contact} />
        <Route component={NotFound} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
};
```

> _Result_: React Router facilitates navigation within React applications, providing a seamless user experience by rendering different components/pages based on the URL path.

> _Conclusion_: Leveraging React Router simplifies the implementation of routing in React applications, making it easier for developers to create single-page applications with multiple views and navigation capabilities.

## 4> What are higher-order components (HOCs) in React? Provide an example

> _Purpose_: Higher-order components (HOCs) are a pattern in React for reusing component logic by wrapping components with other components. HOCs enhance component composition and allow cross-cutting concerns like data fetching, authentication, or styling to be applied to multiple components.

> _Process_: HOCs are functions that take a component as input and return a new component with additional functionality. They can modify props, render additional elements, or handle lifecycle methods.

> _Example_:

```jsx
// Higher-order component for adding authentication logic
const withAuth = (WrappedComponent) => {
  const isAuthenticated = checkAuth(); // Function to check if user is authenticated

  const AuthComponent = (props) => {
    if (isAuthenticated) {
      return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
    } else {
      return <Redirect to='/login' />;
    }
  };

  return AuthComponent;
};

// Usage example
const ProfilePage = withAuth(ProfileComponent);
```

> _Result_: Higher-order components enable code reuse and separation of concerns in React applications, allowing developers to apply common functionalities to multiple components easily.

> _Conclusion_: Understanding and leveraging higher-order components in React development can lead to cleaner, more modular, and reusable codebases, improving maintainability and scalability.

## 5> How do you manage the global state in React without using Redux?

> _Purpose_: Managing global state in React without Redux involves using alternative state management solutions like Context API, third-party libraries such as MobX or Recoil, or custom solutions based on React hooks.

> _Process_: Context API allows creating a global state accessible to all components in the component tree without prop drilling. Third-party libraries like MobX provide observable state management with automatic updates. Custom solutions can be implemented using React hooks like useState or useReducer to manage global state within a context provider.

> _Example_:

```jsx
// Using Context API for global state management
const GlobalStateContext = React.createContext();

const GlobalStateProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [globalState, setGlobalState] = useState(initialState);

  return <GlobalStateContext.Provider value={{ globalState, setGlobalState }}>{children}</GlobalStateContext.Provider>;
};

// Usage example
const MyComponent = () => {
  const { globalState, setGlobalState } = useContext(GlobalStateContext);
  // Access and update global state
};

// Using MobX for global state management
import { observable, action } from 'mobx';

class Store {
  @observable globalState = initialState;

  @action setGlobalState(newState) {
    this.globalState = newState;
  }
}

// Usage example
const store = new Store();
store.setGlobalState(newState);
```

> _Result_: Managing global state without Redux provides flexibility and simplicity, allowing developers to choose the approach that best fits their project requirements and preferences.

> _Conclusion_: Understanding various alternatives to Redux for global state management in React enables developers to select the most suitable solution for their specific use case, balancing simplicity, performance, and scalability.

## 6> What is the significance of the shouldComponentUpdate() method in React?

> _Purpose_: The shouldComponentUpdate() method in React allows developers to optimize performance by controlling when a component should re-render. It determines whether the component should proceed with the rendering process or not based on changes in props or state.

> _Process_: shouldComponentUpdate() is invoked before rendering when new props or state are received. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the component should update or not. By default, React components re-render whenever their props or state change. Implementing shouldComponentUpdate() allows developers to prevent unnecessary re-renders and improve performance.

> _Example_:

```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    // Compare current props and state with next props and state
    if (this.props.someProp !== nextProps.someProp || this.state.someState !== nextState.someState) {
      return true; // Allow re-render
    }
    return false; // Prevent re-render
  }

  render() {
    // Component rendering logic
  }
}
```

> _Result_: Implementing shouldComponentUpdate() effectively can reduce the number of re-renders in React applications, leading to improved performance and smoother user experiences, especially in large or complex component trees.

> _Conclusion_: Understanding and utilizing the shouldComponentUpdate() method appropriately empowers developers to optimize rendering performance in React applications, ensuring efficient use of resources and better user interactions.

## 7> How do you handle authentication and authorization in React applications?

> _Purpose_: Handling authentication and authorization in React applications ensures secure access to resources and features based on user identity and permissions.

> _Process_: Authentication involves verifying user identity, usually through credentials like username/password or tokens like JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Once authenticated, authorization determines which resources or features a user can access based on their role or permissions.

> _Example_:

```jsx
// Authentication example using JWT token
const login = async (username, password) => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post('/api/login', { username, password });
    const { token } = response.data;
    localStorage.setItem('token', token);
    // Set token in global state or context for future requests
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Login failed:', error);
  }
};

// Authorization example using protected routes
const PrivateRoute = ({ component: Component, ...rest }) => <Route {...rest} render={(props) => (isAuthenticated() ? <Component {...props} /> : <Redirect to='/login' />)} />;

// Usage example
<Router>
  <Switch>
    <Route path='/login' component={Login} />
    <PrivateRoute path='/dashboard' component={Dashboard} />
    <PrivateRoute path='/profile' component={Profile} />
  </Switch>
</Router>;
```

> _Result_: Properly implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms in React applications ensures secure access control, protecting sensitive data and functionalities from unauthorized users.

> _Conclusion_: Integrating authentication and authorization features into React applications is crucial for maintaining data security and user privacy, enhancing the overall trustworthiness and reliability of the software solution.

## 8> Explain the concept of lazy loading in React and its benefits

> _Purpose_: Lazy loading in React refers to the technique of dynamically loading components or assets only when they are needed, typically during runtime, instead of loading them all upfront during the initial page load.

> _Process_: React.lazy() is a built-in React feature that allows developers to dynamically import components using dynamic import() syntax. This enables lazy loading of components, improving the initial loading performance of the application by reducing the bundle size and deferring the loading of non-essential resources.

> _Example_:

```jsx
// Lazy loading example using React.lazy and Suspense
const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

const MyComponent = () => (
  <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
    <LazyComponent />
  </Suspense>
);
```

> _Result_: Lazy loading optimizes the initial loading performance of React applications by splitting the bundle into smaller chunks and loading components on demand, resulting in faster page loads and improved user experience, especially for large or complex applications.

> _Conclusion_: Incorporating lazy loading into React applications is an effective strategy for optimizing performance, reducing initial load times, and enhancing the overall responsiveness of the user interface, particularly in scenarios with large component trees or multiple routes.

## 9> What are controlled and uncontrolled components in React?

> _Purpose_: In React, controlled and uncontrolled components refer to two different approaches for managing form inputs and their corresponding state within React components.

> _Process_:
>
> - Controlled components are React components where form data is controlled by React state. Input elements in controlled components receive their current value from state and trigger updates through event handlers that update the state
> - Uncontrolled components, on the other hand, allow form data to be controlled by the DOM itself. The state of the form elements is managed by the DOM, and React does not have direct control over their values.

> _Example_:

```jsx
// Controlled component example
class ControlledForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { value: '' };
  }

  handleChange = (event) => {
    this.setState({ value: event.target.value });
  };

  handleSubmit = (event) => {
    alert('A name was submitted: ' + this.state.value);
    event.preventDefault();
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          Name:
          <input type='text' value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />
        </label>
        <input type='submit' value='Submit' />
      </form>
    );
  }
}

// Uncontrolled component example
const UncontrolledForm = () => {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    alert('A name was submitted: ' + inputRef.current.value);
    event.preventDefault();
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>
        Name:
        <input type='text' ref={inputRef} />
      </label>
      <input type='submit' value='Submit' />
    </form>
  );
};
```

> _Result_: Controlled components provide more control and synchronization between form elements and React state, making it easier to manage form data and perform validation. Uncontrolled components can be simpler and more efficient for certain use cases, especially when dealing with large forms or integrating with third-party libraries.

> _Conclusion_: Understanding the differences between controlled and uncontrolled components helps developers choose the appropriate approach based on the requirements and complexity of their forms, balancing control, simplicity, and performance.

## 10> How do you handle side effects in React using hooks?

> _Purpose_: Side effects in React refer to operations that are not directly related to rendering, such as data fetching, DOM manipulation, or subscriptions. React hooks provide a clean and concise way to handle side effects in functional components.

> _Process_: The useEffect() hook is commonly used to handle side effects in React. It allows developers to perform side effects after rendering, such as fetching data from an API, subscribing to external events, or updating the DOM, without blocking the render process.

> _Example_:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const DataFetchingComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
        const data = await response.json();
        setData(data);
        setLoading(false);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []); // Empty dependency array to execute effect only once

  return <div>{loading ? <div>Loading...</div> : <div>{data}</div>}</div>;
};
```

> _Result_: By using the useEffect() hook, developers can handle side effects in React components in a declarative and composable manner, improving code readability and maintainability.

> _Conclusion_: Leveraging React hooks like useEffect() for handling side effects allows developers to write more concise and efficient code, separating concerns and enhancing the scalability and flexibility of React components.

## 11> Describe the purpose of error boundaries in React

> _Purpose_: Error boundaries in React are components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors of the whole tree below them.

> _Process_: Error boundaries are regular React components that define componentDidCatch() lifecycle method. This method is invoked when an error occurs during rendering, allowing the component to catch the error, log it, and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the entire application.

> _Example_:

```jsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    this.setState({ hasError: true });
    // Log the error to error reporting service
    logErrorToMyService(error, info);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      // Render fallback UI
      return <div>Something went wrong.</div>;
    }
    return this.props.children;
  }
}

// Usage example
<ErrorBoundary>
  <MyComponent />
</ErrorBoundary>;
```

> _Result_: Error boundaries provide a way to gracefully handle errors and prevent them from propagating up the component tree, which could lead to the entire application crashing. Instead, they enable developers to display user-friendly error messages or fallback UIs, improving the overall robustness and reliability of React applications.

> _Conclusion_: Incorporating error boundaries into React applications enhances error handling and improves user experience by preventing crashes and providing informative error messages or fallback UIs, ultimately leading to more stable and resilient software solutions.

## 12> What are React Portals and why are they used?

> _Purpose_: React Portals provide a way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside of the parent component's DOM hierarchy. They are used to render content into a different part of the DOM, such as a modal or a tooltip, while maintaining the component tree structure and event bubbling semantics.

> _Process_: React Portals are created using the ReactDOM.createPortal() method, which takes two arguments: the JSX content to render and the DOM node to render it into. This allows developers to render components into any part of the DOM, even if it's outside the parent component's DOM hierarchy.

> _Example_:

```jsx
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

const Modal = ({ isOpen, onClose, children }) => {
  return isOpen
    ? ReactDOM.createPortal(
        <div className='modal-overlay'>
          <div className='modal-content'>
            <button onClick={onClose}>Close</button>
            {children}
          </div>
        </div>,
        document.getElementById('modal-root')
      )
    : null;
};

// Usage example
const App = () => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>Open Modal</button>
      <Modal isOpen={isOpen} onClose={() => setIsOpen(false)}>
        <h2>Modal Content</h2>
      </Modal>
    </div>
  );
};
```

> _Result_: React Portals allow developers to render components outside the normal React component hierarchy, enabling the creation of UI patterns like modals, tooltips, and overlays that need to visually "break out" of their parent components while still maintaining React's declarative programming model.

> _Conclusion_: Understanding and utilizing React Portals provides developers with a powerful tool for building flexible and maintainable UI components that require rendering into a different part of the DOM, enhancing the overall user experience and design possibilities in React applications.

## 13> How do you perform server-side rendering (SSR) with React?

> _Purpose_: Server-side rendering (SSR) with React involves rendering React components on the server and sending the generated HTML to the client, improving initial page load performance and search engine optimization (SEO).

> _Process_: SSR with React can be achieved using libraries like Next.js, Razzle, or custom server setups with frameworks like Express.js. The process typically involves setting up a Node.js server to handle HTTP requests, rendering React components on the server using ReactDOMServer, and sending the generated HTML to the client.

> _Example_:

```javascript
// Server-side rendering with Express.js
import express from 'express';
import React from 'react';
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server';
import App from './App';

const server = express();

server.get('*', (req, res) => {
  const appHtml = renderToString(<App />);
  res.send(`
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>React SSR Example</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div id="app">${appHtml}</div>
        <script src="client.bundle.js"></script>
      </body>
    </html>
  `);
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

> _Result_: Server-side rendering with React improves perceived performance by sending pre-rendered HTML to the client, reducing the time needed for initial content display. It also benefits SEO, as search engines can index the content more effectively.

> _Conclusion_: Implementing server-side rendering with React requires configuring a Node.js server to render React components on the server side. By utilizing SSR, developers can enhance the performance and SEO of their React applications, providing a better user experience and improved search engine visibility.

## 14> Explain the concept of code splitting in React

> _Purpose_: Code splitting in React is a technique used to improve performance by splitting the JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks, loading only the necessary code for the current view or feature, and deferring the loading of non-essential code until it's needed.

> _Process_: Code splitting can be achieved using dynamic import() syntax or React.lazy() for components. By dynamically importing modules or components only when they are required, developers can reduce the initial bundle size and improve the load time of the application.

> _Example_:

```jsx
// Code splitting example using dynamic import
const MyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));

// Usage example
const App = () => (
  <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
    <MyComponent />
  </Suspense>
);
```

> _Result_: Code splitting optimizes the initial loading performance of React applications by loading code asynchronously when it's needed, resulting in faster page loads and improved user experience, especially for applications with large or complex codebases.

> _Conclusion_: Incorporating code splitting into React applications is an effective strategy for optimizing performance, reducing initial load times, and enhancing the overall responsiveness of the user interface, particularly in scenarios with large component trees or multiple routes.

## 15> How do you handle routing with parameters in React Router?

> _Purpose_: Handling routing with parameters in React Router allows developers to create dynamic routes that can accept parameters (URL segments) as inputs, enabling customization and dynamic content rendering based on those parameters.

> _Process_: React Router provides a way to define routes with parameters using the colon syntax (:paramName) in the route path. The parameters are then accessible within the component via the route props.

> _Example_:

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch, useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

const UserProfile = () => {
  const { username } = useParams();

  return <div>User profile page for {username}</div>;
};

const App = () => (
  <Router>
    <Switch>
      <Route path='/user/:username' component={UserProfile} />
    </Switch>
  </Router>
);
```

> _Result_: With routing parameters in React Router, developers can create dynamic routes that respond to changes in URL parameters, allowing for personalized and context-aware rendering of components based on the provided parameters.

> _Conclusion_: Understanding and implementing routing with parameters in React Router enables developers to create dynamic and customizable user experiences, where different content or functionality is rendered based on the values passed through URL parameters.

## 16> What is the role of context API in React? Provide a scenario where you would use it

> _Purpose_: The Context API in React provides a way to share data between components without having to explicitly pass props through every level of the component tree. It simplifies state management and makes certain types of data, such as theme preferences or authentication status, accessible to all components in a React application.

> _Process_: Context API consists of two main components: the Provider and the Consumer. The Provider component wraps the part of the component tree where the shared data is declared, while the Consumer component allows components to consume the shared data.

> _Example_:

```jsx
// Context creation
const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

// Context provider
const App = () => (
  <ThemeContext.Provider value='dark'>
    <Toolbar />
  </ThemeContext.Provider>
);

// Context consumer
const Toolbar = () => (
  <div>
    <ThemedButton />
  </div>
);

const ThemedButton = () => <ThemeContext.Consumer>{(theme) => <button style={{ background: theme }}>I am styled by theme context!</button>}</ThemeContext.Consumer>;
```

> _Result_: Context API allows components to access shared data without having to pass props explicitly, improving code maintainability and reducing prop drilling in deeply nested component trees.

> _Conclusion_: Context API in React serves as a powerful tool for managing global or shared state across components, offering a cleaner and more efficient alternative to prop drilling. It is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple components need access to the same data, such as theming, localization, or user authentication.

## 17> How do you test React components?

> _Purpose_: Testing React components ensures that they behave as expected, maintain functionality across changes, and prevent regressions. Various testing techniques and libraries are available for testing React components, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

> _Process_: React components can be tested using testing libraries such as Jest, React Testing Library, Enzyme, or Cypress. Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation, while integration tests verify interactions between multiple components. End-to-end tests simulate user interactions and test the entire application flow.

> _Example_:

```jsx
// Example of testing a React component using Jest and React Testing Library
import React from 'react';
import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import Button from './Button';

test('renders button with correct label', () => {
  const { getByText } = render(<Button label='Click me' />);
  const buttonElement = getByText('Click me');
  expect(buttonElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});

test('button click event handler is called', () => {
  const handleClick = jest.fn();
  const { getByText } = render(<Button label='Click me' onClick={handleClick} />);
  const buttonElement = getByText('Click me');
  fireEvent.click(buttonElement);
  expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
});
```

> _Result_: Testing React components ensures that they behave as expected and helps catch bugs and regressions early in the development process, improving code quality and reliability.

> _Conclusion_: Implementing testing for React components using appropriate testing libraries and techniques is essential for maintaining code quality, preventing regressions, and ensuring a smooth user experience in React applications.

## 18> Explain the concept of memoization in React and its benefits

> _Purpose_: Memoization in React is a performance optimization technique used to cache the results of expensive function calls and avoid redundant computations. It helps improve the performance of React components by storing the results of function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

> _Process_: Memoization can be implemented using techniques such as memoization functions, memoized selectors, or React's built-in useMemo() hook. By memoizing expensive function calls or computations, React components can avoid unnecessary re-renders and optimize rendering performance.

> _Example_:

```jsx
import React, { useMemo } from 'react';

const ExpensiveComponent = ({ data }) => {
  const expensiveResult = useMemo(() => {
    // Expensive computation or function call
    return computeExpensiveResult(data);
  }, [data]); // Memoize result based on data dependency

  return <div>{expensiveResult}</div>;
};
```

> _Result_: Memoization in React improves rendering performance by caching the results of expensive computations and preventing unnecessary recalculations. It reduces the workload on the CPU and speeds up component rendering, leading to a smoother user experience.

> _Conclusion_: Incorporating memoization techniques like useMemo() in React components helps optimize performance by reducing unnecessary computations and re-renders. It is particularly useful for optimizing components that perform complex calculations or data processing, improving overall application responsiveness and user satisfaction.

## 19> What are React fragments and when would you use them?

> _Purpose_: React fragments provide a way to group multiple JSX elements without introducing unnecessary wrapper elements in the DOM. They are useful when you need to return multiple elements from a component's render method but don't want to add extra DOM nodes to the output.

> _Process_: React fragments are represented by empty angle brackets <> or by using the <React.Fragment> syntax. They allow developers to group elements together without creating an additional parent element in the rendered output.

> _Example_:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <>
    <div>Element 1</div>
    <div>Element 2</div>
  </>
);
```

> _Result_: React fragments improve code readability and maintainability by avoiding unnecessary wrapper elements in the rendered output. They help keep the DOM structure clean and concise while allowing developers to structure their JSX code in a more logical and intuitive way.

> _Conclusion_: React fragments are a lightweight and convenient way to group multiple JSX elements without introducing extra DOM nodes. They are particularly useful when returning multiple elements or rendering lists from React components, enhancing code organization and readability without impacting the rendered output.

## 20> How do you handle AJAX requests in React applications?

> _Purpose_: Handling AJAX requests in React applications involves fetching data from remote servers asynchronously and updating the UI based on the received data. AJAX requests are commonly used to interact with APIs, retrieve data, and update the application state.

> _Process_: React applications typically use JavaScript libraries like Axios, Fetch API, or built-in browser APIs like XMLHttpRequest to make AJAX requests. These libraries provide methods for making HTTP requests and handling responses asynchronously. Developers can use lifecycle methods like componentDidMount() or useEffect() hook to trigger AJAX requests and update the component state with the received data.

Example using Axios:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await axios.get('https://api.example.com/data');
        setData(response.data);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
      }
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {data ? (
        <ul>
          {data.map((item) => (
            <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      ) : (
        <div>Loading...</div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

> _Result_: By handling AJAX requests in React applications, developers can fetch data from remote servers and update the UI dynamically, providing users with real-time information and interactive experiences.

> _Conclusion_: Implementing AJAX request handling in React applications allows developers to interact with external APIs, retrieve data asynchronously, and update the UI accordingly. It enables the creation of dynamic and responsive web applications that provide seamless user experiences.

## 21> Explain the JWT token

> _Purpose_: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a compact and self-contained way of securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. They are commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications.

> _Process_: JWTs consist of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature, separated by dots (e.g., xxx.yyy.zzz). The header typically contains the type of token and the signing algorithm, the payload contains the claims or information being transmitted, and the signature is used to verify the authenticity of the token.

> _Example_:

```plaintext
Header: {
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
Payload: {
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": true
}
Signature: HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret)
```

> _Result_: JWTs provide a way to securely authenticate users and transmit information between the client and server without the need for server-side sessions. They are stateless, which means that servers do not need to store user sessions, making them scalable and suitable for use in distributed systems.

> _Conclusion_: Understanding JWTs and their role in authentication and authorization is essential for building secure web applications. By leveraging JWTs, developers can implement token-based authentication mechanisms that are efficient, scalable, and interoperable across different platforms and technologies.

## 22> Explain Webpack and its configuration

> _Purpose_: Webpack is a popular module bundler for JavaScript applications, commonly used in React projects. It bundles various modules and assets, such as JavaScript files, CSS files, and images, into a single bundle that can be served to the browser. Webpack helps manage dependencies, optimize code, and improve performance.

> _Process_: Webpack configuration is typically defined in a file named webpack.config.js in the project root. This configuration file specifies entry points, output paths, loaders for different file types, plugins for additional functionalities like code splitting or minification, and other settings.

> _Example of a simple webpack.config.js_:

```javascript
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'bundle.js'
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: 'babel-loader'
      },
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader']
      },
      {
        test: /\.(png|svg|jpg|jpeg|gif)$/i,
        type: 'asset/resource'
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

> _Result_: Webpack configuration defines how the application's source code and assets are processed, bundled, and outputted. By customizing webpack.config.js, developers can optimize the build process, manage dependencies, and improve the performance of their React applications.

> _Conclusion_: Understanding Webpack and its configuration is crucial for modern web development, especially in React projects where it is commonly used for bundling assets. With proper configuration, Webpack can greatly simplify the development workflow and enhance the performance and scalability of React applications.

## 24> Have you worked on accessibility in HTML, have you used the aria, tell some aria names that you have used?

> _Purpose_: Accessibility (a11y) in HTML ensures that web content is accessible to people with disabilities, including those who rely on assistive technologies such as screen readers. ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes enhance the accessibility of web content by providing additional semantics and context to assistive technologies.

> _Process_: ARIA attributes can be added to HTML elements to convey information about roles, states, properties, and relationships to assistive technologies. Some commonly used ARIA attributes include aria-label, aria-labelledby, aria-describedby, aria-hidden, aria-disabled, aria-haspopup, aria-expanded, aria-checked, and aria-live.

> _Example_:

```html
<button aria-label="Close" onclick="closeModal()">×</button>

<div id="dialog" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="dialog-title">
  <h2 id="dialog-title">Dialog Title</h2>
  <p id="dialog-desc">Dialog Description</p>
</div>

<input type="text" aria-describedby="username-help" />
<p id="username-help">Please enter your username.</p>
```

> _Result_: By using ARIA attributes appropriately, developers can improve the accessibility of their web applications, making them more usable and navigable for people with disabilities. ARIA attributes provide semantic information that assistive technologies can use to convey context and functionality to users.

## 25> What is the difference between fetch and Axios?

> _Purpose_: Both fetch and Axios are JavaScript libraries used for making HTTP requests in web applications. Understanding the differences between them helps developers choose the right tool for their specific use cases.

> _Process_: Fetch is a built-in browser API for making HTTP requests, while Axios is a third-party library that provides a more user-friendly interface and additional features for making HTTP requests. Fetch is Promise-based and provides a simple and lightweight way to fetch resources, but it requires more manual handling of responses and errors compared to Axios.

> _Example_:

```javascript
// Using fetch
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error('Error fetching data:', error));

// Using Axios
axios
  .get('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then((response) => console.log(response.data))
  .catch((error) => console.error('Error fetching data:', error));
```

> _Result_: Axios provides a more feature-rich and user-friendly API for making HTTP requests, including support for request and response interceptors, automatic JSON parsing, and error handling. Fetch, on the other hand, is a built-in browser API with a simpler interface but lacks some of the conveniences provided by Axios.

> _Conclusion_: When choosing between fetch and Axios, developers should consider factors such as ease of use, feature requirements, and compatibility with existing code. Axios is often preferred for its additional features and ease of use, especially in complex applications where more advanced HTTP request handling is required.

By carefully planning and configuring project setup, developers can create a solid foundation for building scalable, maintainable, and high-quality software solutions.

## 27> What is CORS?

> _Purpose_: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security mechanism implemented by web browsers to control access to resources (e.g., APIs) on a different origin (domain, protocol, or port) from the requesting web page. It is designed to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests that could lead to security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or data theft.

> _Process_: CORS works by adding HTTP headers to responses from the server, indicating whether cross-origin requests from a particular origin are allowed or restricted. When a browser makes a cross-origin request, it sends a preflight request (OPTIONS) to the server to determine if the actual request (e.g., GET, POST) is allowed. If the server responds with appropriate CORS headers allowing the request, the browser proceeds with the actual request.

Example CORS headers:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization
```

> _Result_: CORS enables web servers to control which origins are allowed to access their resources, providing a layer of security against unauthorized cross-origin requests. By enforcing same-origin policies, CORS helps protect sensitive data and prevent malicious attacks on web applications.

> _Conclusion_: Understanding CORS is essential for web developers, especially when building web applications that interact with APIs hosted on different domains. By configuring CORS policies appropriately on server-side endpoints, developers can ensure secure and controlled access to resources, maintaining the integrity and security of their web applications.

## 28> Explain CSRF

> _Purpose_: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to trick a user into unintentionally performing actions on a web application in which they are authenticated. CSRF attacks exploit the trust that a web application has in a user's browser by forging requests that appear to be legitimate.

> _Process_: In a CSRF attack, an attacker crafts a malicious web page or email containing a request to a vulnerable web application endpoint. When a user who is authenticated to the vulnerable application visits the attacker's page or opens the email, their browser automatically sends the forged request along with their session credentials, causing the server to execute the request as if it were legitimate.

> _Example_:

```html
<!-- Malicious page with CSRF attack -->
<html>
  <body>
    <form id="csrfForm" action="https://example.com/update-profile" method="post">
      <input type="hidden" name="email" value="attacker@example.com" />
      <input type="hidden" name="password" value="password123" />
    </form>
    <script>
      document.getElementById('csrfForm').submit(); // Automatically submit form
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

> _Result_: CSRF attacks can lead to unauthorized actions such as changing user passwords, updating profile information, transferring funds, or making purchases without the user's consent. They pose a significant threat to web applications, particularly those that lack proper CSRF protection mechanisms.

> _Conclusion_: Protecting against CSRF attacks requires implementing measures such as using anti-CSRF tokens, checking the origin or referrer headers of incoming requests, and enforcing strict access controls on sensitive operations. By mitigating CSRF vulnerabilities, web developers can safeguard the integrity and security of their applications and protect users from unauthorized actions.

## 29> What is the difference between types and interfaces?

> _Purpose_: In TypeScript, both types and interfaces are used to define shapes or structures of data. Understanding the differences between them helps developers choose the appropriate tool for defining custom data types in their code.

> _Process_: Types and interfaces serve similar purposes in TypeScript but have some differences in their capabilities and usage. Interfaces are primarily used for defining object shapes, while types can represent a broader range of data structures, including primitives, unions, intersections, and aliases.

> _Example_:

```typescript
// Using an interface
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

// Using a type alias
type Point = {
  x: number;
  y: number;
};

// Using a type
type Status = 'active' | 'inactive';
```

> _Result_: Interfaces are more commonly used for defining object shapes, particularly when defining contracts or contracts between different parts of code. Types, on the other hand, offer more flexibility and can represent a wider range of data structures, making them suitable for various use cases, including primitive types, unions, and aliases.

> _Conclusion_: Choosing between types and interfaces in TypeScript depends on the specific requirements and use cases of the project. Interfaces are preferred when defining object shapes and contracts, while types are more versatile and can be used to represent a broader range of data structures and patterns. By leveraging both types and interfaces effectively, developers can create robust and maintainable TypeScript codebases.

## 32> Name the hooks that are used to add some rules before committing the code?

> _Purpose_: Git hooks are scripts that run automatically before or after certain Git events, such as committing code changes, pushing commits to a remote repository, or merging branches. These hooks allow developers to enforce rules, perform actions, or execute custom scripts to maintain code quality and project standards.

> _Process_: Git hooks are stored in the `.git/hooks` directory of a Git repository and are triggered by specific Git events. Some commonly used Git hooks for adding rules before committing code include:
>
> 1. **pre-commit**: This hook is executed immediately before a commit is made. It can be used to enforce code formatting rules, run linters, or execute pre-commit tests to ensure that committed code meets quality standards before it is saved in the repository.
> 2. **pre-push**: This hook is triggered before remote references are updated during a push operation. It can be used to run additional tests, check for code conflicts, or perform any other actions to verify the integrity and quality of the pushed changes before they are sent to the remote repository.

> _Example usage of pre-commit hook_:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Run linter before committing
npm run lint
# Run tests before committing
npm run test
```

> _Result_: By configuring pre-commit and pre-push hooks in a Git repository, developers can automate code quality checks, enforce coding standards, and prevent committing or pushing code that does not meet predefined criteria. This helps maintain code consistency, improve code quality, and prevent common errors and issues from being introduced into the codebase.
